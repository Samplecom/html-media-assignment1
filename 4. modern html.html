Use Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>. Utilize these elements to provide a clear and structured hierarchy to your content. Screen readers and other assistive technologies can use these elements to better understand the page's structure.

Alternative Text for Images: Always include descriptive alternative text (alt attributes) for images using the <img> element. This text should convey the content and purpose of the image to users who cannot see it.

Video and Audio Accessibility: When using the <video> and <audio> elements, provide text transcripts and captions or subtitles for multimedia content. This makes videos and audio content accessible to users with hearing or visual impairments.

Form Accessibility: HTML5 provides enhanced form input types (<input type="email">, <input type="date">, etc.) and attributes (required, placeholder, etc.) that can improve form accessibility.
