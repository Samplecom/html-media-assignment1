1. list out the features of HTML5

Semantic Elements:
 HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, and <aside>

Audio and Video Support: 
HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video elements using <audio> and <video> tags, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Adobe Flash.
Canvas: The <canvas> element allows for dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and games directly within the browser using JavaScript.
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): HTML5 provides native support for SVG, allowing the integration of vector graphics into web pages.
Improved Forms: 
HTML5 introduces new input types like <input type="date">, <input type="email">, <input type="url">, and more, along with attributes like required, placeholder, and autofocus, making form handling and validation easier.
Web Storage: 
HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs to store data locally on the user's device, providing a more efficient and persistent way to manage client-side data.
CSS3: 
While not part of HTML5 itself, CSS3 was developed in tandem with HTML5, providing advanced styling and layout options, including animations and transitions.

Cross-document Messaging: 
HTML5 introduced the postMessage API, which allows different windows or iframes to communicate securely with each other, enabling seamless integration of content.

Improved Accessibility: 
HTML5 includes features and attributes that enhance web accessibility, making it easier for people with disabilities to access and interact with web content.

Offline Application Cache: 
The Application Cache (AppCache) feature allows web applications to work offline by caching resources and enabling them to be accessed without an internet connection.

New Doctype: 
HTML5 uses a simplified <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, making it easier to start coding web pages without complex document type declarations.

Semantic Markup: 
HTML5 emphasizes semantic markup, helping search engines and assistive technologies better understand and index web content.
